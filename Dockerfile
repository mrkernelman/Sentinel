# --workers 1: the Live Scan collector (ml/collector.py) is an in-memory
# singleton, not shared across processes. With >1 worker, requests
# round-robin between independent collectors, so /api/scan/start can land
# on one worker while /api/scan/status polls another that never started
# anything -- looks like the scan randomly stops/restarts. One worker means
# one collector, so there's nothing to desync. Single-threaded API is an
# accepted trade-off at this app's request volume.
# --timeout 120: gives long-running /api/scan/flush or /api/scan/detections
# calls headroom so gunicorn's watchdog doesn't SIGKILL the whole worker
# process mid-request -- which would also kill the collector's daemon
# threads living in it.
